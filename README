
(1) Simulation of SNP Data (as table)
main.R  sources the Simulation of SNP positions and phasing for a certain contig or chromosome 
        with given parameters and a reference Genome
        Output: "outPath/[Label].txt"                                   Table of SNP Data
                "outPath/[Label]_meta.txt"                              Meta Information which is used by generateVCF.sh
                "pathDat/simulatedData/timingSimulation_[Label].txt"    Timing of Simulation
                "outPath/[Label].RData"                                 Backup of SNP positions, phasings, dosages, parameters, haploblock limits

parameters/parameters.R stores parameters for Simulation
programs/*  are sourced by main.R
functions/* are used by programs.R and sourced by main.R
analyze_simulation_output.R analyzes the generated SNP table

Comment: In the R simulation Code sometimes haploblocks are wrongly refered to as haplotypes


(2) Transformation of SNP Data into a VCF
generateVCF.sh

(3) Generates Reads from Reference Genome while incorporating SNPs from VCF using the program NGSNGS
generateReads.sh
